## Co-existing with flat design

This article needs work and review. It is a very early draft

**Draft datestamp:** `MONDAY::2021::SEP::27::00:14:20:000000` This is a very early drat and needs improvement.

Flat design and its variants aren't all bad. I believe that flat design should be a choice and a right, the same goes with Skeuomorphism. Both design styles should be a choice, and both design styles should be a right, a digital right for the expression of artistic freedom and choice.

## Fix your design

Pixel art is a unique artform, and can be grouped into flat design or skeuomorphism

Gradients and patterns are good

Gloss is good, when necessary. Don't just put a single stripe of gloss over an existing image and call it done (no, this is not what was done in 2005, mostly in 2005, it was a bit more detailed as well)

## Pixel art

Pixel art is its own category. It should be treated fairly. There are also depth levels associated with pixel art design. Good Pixel art, like SKeuomorphism is a complex and detailed craft, and should be treated with respect. It may look easy, but Pixel Art is a very difficult field, and it takes time to make quality good pixel art, just like it requires time to make quality good skeuomorphic designs.

## Neumorphism

For flat design lovers and Apple fans, Neumorphism is a good path for some.

## Skeuowie and flat design

Skeuowie will never offer flat design, try another desktop environment.
